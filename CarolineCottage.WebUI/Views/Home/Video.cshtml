    Visit <a href="http://www.manonabeach.com" target="_blank">manonabeach.com</a>. 
    If you haven’t seen the website before, it’s definitely worth a look. See if you can find the entry for your favourite beach in Cornwall, apart from Mousehole. What would you have said about it if you’d been interviewed?
