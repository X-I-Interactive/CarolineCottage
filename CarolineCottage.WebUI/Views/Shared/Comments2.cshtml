    We parked the car on arrival and didn’t move it until we went home…

    … another wonderful holiday in Mousehole – extra special due to Caroline Cottage…
    home comforts and fantastic views across the bay to St Michael’s Mount, Goonhilly
    and Lizard
</p>

    Thank you for all the thought you have put into this place
</p>
<p>
    Thank you for allowing me all the creature comforts I always miss on holiday whilst
    also providing gorgeous views of the sea and picturesque village!

<p>
    … how can you improve a perfect place…

    Lovely cottage… gorgeous village… The cottage is unexpectedly massive and really
    comfortable… I have designed my dream house on the layout of this place…

    We thought that it might be tough dragging 4 teenagers away from their friends and
    computer for a week, but they had a great time…. See, they can survive without MSN!

    My first visit to Mousehole. Beautiful! Lovely homely cottage, you seem to have
    thought of everything…
