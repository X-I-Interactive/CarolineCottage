        CAROLINE COTTAGE is a deceptively spacious granite cottage, situated on the
        main street and backing onto Keigwin Place some 100 metres from the beach and harbour.

        The bedrooms and bathroom are at street level and the living areas upstairs. From
        the open-plan lounge (c. 18') and balcony there are wonderful views over the rooftops (complete
        with seagulls) and St Clement’s Isle, and across Mount’s Bay to St Michael’s Mount.
        The spacious kitchen/dining room (c. 20') has a traditional Cornish range and a well-equipped
        wood-fitted kitchen. The table seats 8. Our studio annexe, “The Dungeon”, is at a lower level on Keigwin
        Square. Double futon plus shower.

        We provide lots of books, games, dvds and puzzles for all ages.

        2001 was our first letting year - we continue to run bookings ourselves so that
        we can respond in person to your queries. After your stay we welcome any suggestions
        for added comfort. Our aim is that you find the cottage both beautiful and homely,
        to make your holiday a real pleasure – and hopefully one that you will look forward
        to repeating!

        Our booking information includes more useful information on the cottage and village.
        We offer some flexibility e.g. for short or off-peak stays. For most of us holidays
        are a well-earned break, so we have been keen to make the cottage attractive and
        comfortable for maximum enjoyment.
