    The PENWITH PENINSULA: some of its loveliest spots are in easy reach of Mousehole
    – hidden coves like Penberth ; the Minack Theatre at Porthcurno ; Land’s End and
    the wild north-west coast ; St Ives with its Cornwall Tate Gallery; Marazion with
    its artists’ galleries and the causeway to St Michael’s Mount. Seals can sometimes
    be seen, including from the Mousehole rock pools. Basking sharks pass the coast
    in early summer.

    Walks from Mousehole include to the neighbouring villages of Paul (beautiful church,
    good pub) and Sheffield, or further afield to Lamorna Cove and The Wink Inn. Regular
    minibuses run to the fishing port of Newlyn (buy local crab and fish, visit Newlyn
    Art Gallery) and to Penzance – plenty of shopping and eateries. Penzance has a mainline
    rail station and good bus services to St Ives and Marazion etc., the “Scillonian”
    ferry to the Isles of Scilly – so there are plenty of car-free options.
